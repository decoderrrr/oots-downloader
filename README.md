A simple "The Order Of The Stick" comic downloader written in python.

I'm a big fan of this webcomic, but I find very annoying to read it from the original website. This script helps me to download the latest comics and read them comfortably in my Mac.

You can find the original comics by Rich Burlew here: http://www.giantitp.com/Comics.html
